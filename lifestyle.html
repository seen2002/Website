                   It was designed so that the greater number of people could see the Pope give his blessings either from the middle of the façade
                   of the church or from a window in the Vatican Palace.

                        <p>
                            While the city may be better known for its more austere attractions, the nightlife in Rome offers a vibrant alternative for tourists looking for a night out on the town.
                             With bars and clubs located in buildings that have been around for centuries, tourists will often find themselves partying in an interesting atmosphere where nightlife and history occupy the same space.
                            One of the best-known nightlife areas in Rome, Campo de’ Fiori, is a square in the city centre that is close to the banks of the Tiber.
                             Popular with tourists and locals, there are dozens of bars and restaurants nearby that cater to a wide variety of tastes. 

                             <img src="C:\Users\cse20-006\Documents\wmd website\images\campo.jpg" class="third" alt="place in rome" height="260px" >

                             It is especially recommended that tourists go around sunset to relax over a drink or two as the tops of the buildings are bathed in a golden aura.
                            Another popular area is Piazza degli Aurunci, which is situated in the San Lorenzo university district. Frequented by a younger, more alternative crowd,
                            
                            <img src="C:\Users\cse20-006\Documents\wmd website\images\bar.jpg" class="fourth" alt="place in rome" height="260px" >

                            the steps of the piazza are occupied by all types of people gathering to enjoy time with friends and enjoy an affordable night out.
                            Occasionally, there are music and other cultural events that happen around here.
                            For a more dynamic experience, tourists should head to Testaccio, which is widely recognised as the city’s clubbing district but also offers some of the best authentic Italian cuisine in the city. As night falls, 
                            the district starts attracting dressed-up revellers wanting to dance the night away. If you prefer their music to be less electronic will also enjoy some of the area’s live music venues.

                        <h2>Eating out in Rome</h2>
                              
                        <img src="C:\Users\cse20-006\Documents\wmd website\images\rest.jpg" class="third" alt="place in rome" height="260px" >

                        <p>
                            You will be spoilt for choice when it comes to excellent dining options in Rome. Countless authentic Italian eateries line the streets, each with its unique charm and avour. 
                            While restaurants serving classic Italian mainstays like pasta and pizza are plentiful, with a little exploration, you will find many hidden gems serving all sorts of exotic cuisine like Thai dishes, Spanish streetfood or Middle Eastern fare.
                            There are also plenty of opportunities to pick up artisanal paninis packed with fresh and delicious ingredients at one of the many cafés dotted around the city. Lastly, don't forget to sample Italian gelato at one of Rome's many gelaterias.
                            One tip to bear in mind is to avoid restaurants near tourist attractions as they tend to be busy and overpriced, and the food is often mediocre or worse. There are exceptions to this rule, but they are few and far between.
